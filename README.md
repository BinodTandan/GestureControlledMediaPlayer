# Gesture Controlled Media Player ðŸŽ®ðŸŽµ

Control your media player using real-time hand gestures and a CNN-based classifier.

## Current Gestures:
- Play
- Pause
- Volume Up
- Volume Down
- Next Track
- Previous Track
- Mute
- Stop

## How It Works:
- Hand gestures are recognized using a trained CNN model.
- Real-time webcam input is processed.
- Gestures are mapped to media control actions.

## Project Structure:
- `data/` â€“ Gesture images organized by class
- `train_model.ipynb` â€“ CNN model training
- `real_time_control.py` â€“ Real-time gesture recognition and control
- `model/` â€“ Trained Models
- `utils/preprocess.py` â€“ Webcamp frame resizing

## ðŸ“¥ Dataset:
- Prepare your dataset by organizing gesture images into separate folders for each class under the `data/` directory.
- Each folder should be named according to the gesture label (e.g., `play`, `pause`, `stop`, etc.).

## ðŸ§ª How to Run:

### Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BinodTandan/GestureControlledMediaPlayer.git
cd gesture-controlled-media-player


### Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the training notebook:
Open train_model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Execute all cells in order.
Ensure that the notebook is fully executed with output cells visible.
